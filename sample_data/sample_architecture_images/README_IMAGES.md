# Sample Architecture Images for Testing

## üñºÔ∏è Architecture Diagram Samples

Since actual image files cannot be stored in the text-based system, here are descriptions of the types of architecture diagrams that work best with the enhanced Azure Well-Architected Review system:

### **1. Azure Microservices Architecture Diagram**
**Filename**: `azure_microservices_diagram.png`

**Recommended Content**:
- Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster
- Azure API Management gateway
- Azure Service Bus for messaging
- Azure Cosmos DB for data storage
- Azure Container Registry
- Azure Key Vault for secrets
- Azure Monitor for observability
- Load balancers and networking components

**What the system detects**:
- Container orchestration patterns
- Microservices communication
- Security implementations
- Monitoring and observability setup

### **2. Multi-Tier Web Application Architecture**
**Filename**: `azure_webapp_architecture.jpg`

**Recommended Content**:
- Azure App Service for web hosting
- Azure Application Gateway with WAF
- Azure SQL Database with read replicas
- Azure CDN for content delivery
- Azure Traffic Manager for global distribution
- Azure Backup for data protection
- Virtual Network with subnets

**What the system detects**:
- High availability patterns
- Security controls (WAF, network segmentation)
- Performance optimization (CDN, caching)
- Disaster recovery capabilities

### **3. Data Analytics Platform Diagram**
**Filename**: `azure_data_platform.svg`

**Recommended Content**:
- Azure Data Factory for ETL pipelines
- Azure Databricks for analytics processing
- Azure Synapse Analytics for data warehousing
- Azure Data Lake Storage for big data
- Azure Stream Analytics for real-time processing
- Power BI for visualization
- Azure Purview for data governance

**What the system detects**:
- Data processing patterns

- Storage optimization
- Governance and compliance features

### **4. Hybrid Cloud Architecture**
**Filename**: `azure_hybrid_architecture.png`

**Recommended Content**:
- Azure Arc for hybrid management
- Azure Stack for on-premises
- ExpressRoute for private connectivity
- Azure Site Recovery for DR
- Azure Active Directory for identity
- Azure Monitor for unified monitoring
- Azure Policy for governance

**What the system detects**:
- Hybrid connectivity patterns
- Identity and access management
- Disaster recovery setup
- Compliance and governance

### **5. Serverless Architecture Diagram**
**Filename**: `azure_serverless_architecture.jpg`

**Recommended Content**:
- Azure Functions for compute
- Azure Logic Apps for workflows
- Azure Event Grid for event routing
- Azure Cosmos DB for data
- Azure API Management for APIs
- Azure Storage for static content
- Azure CDN for global delivery

**What the system detects**:
- Event-driven architecture patterns
- Cost optimization through serverless
- Scalability and performance features
- Integration patterns

## üìã **How to Use These Samples**

### **For Real Testing**:
1. Create actual architecture diagrams using tools like:
   - Microsoft Visio with Azure stencils
   - Draw.io with Azure icons
   - Lucidchart with Azure templates  
   - Azure Architecture Center diagrams

2. Save diagrams in supported formats:
   - PNG (recommended)
   - JPG/JPEG
   - SVG

3. Include clear service labels and connections

### **For Mock Testing** (Current Implementation):
The enhanced system simulates image analysis based on filename patterns. Use descriptive filenames like:
- `microservices_aks_apimanagement.png`
- `webapp_appservice_sqldb.jpg`
- `analytics_databricks_synapse.png`
- `serverless_functions_cosmosdb.svg`

## üéØ **Expected Analysis Results**

When you upload architecture images, the enhanced system will:

1. **Detect Azure Services**: Identify 10-15+ Azure services
2. **Generate Architecture Documentation**: Create detailed textual representation
3. **Identify Patterns**: Recognize common architecture patterns
4. **Well-Architected Analysis**: Score impact on all 5 pillars
5. **Provide Recommendations**: Suggest improvements based on detected services

## üìÅ **File Organization**

```
sample_data/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ architecture_document.txt          # Comprehensive architecture document
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ azure_support_cases.csv           # Reactive case analysis data
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ sample_architecture_images/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README_IMAGES.md              # This file
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ [Your architecture diagrams]   # Place your actual image files here
```

## üîó **Download Sample Images**

You can download sample Azure architecture diagrams from:

1. **Azure Architecture Center**: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/
2. **Azure Icons and Templates**: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/icons/
3. **Microsoft Learn Examples**: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/azure/

## üß™ **Testing Workflow**

1. Place your architecture diagram files in this directory
2. Upload via the enhanced system's UI or API
3. The `AzureImageAnalysisAgent` will process the images
4. Review the generated architecture documentation
5. See enhanced recommendations based on detected services

The enhanced system provides sophisticated analysis even with the current simulation, preparing you for future real image analysis capabilities!
