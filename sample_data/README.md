- **Use Case**: Test image analysis and service detection capabilities

## üöÄ **How to Use These Samples**

### **Quick Start Testing**

1. **Upload Architecture Document**:
   ```bash
   # Via API
   curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/assessments/{id}/documents" \
        -F "file=@sample_data/architecture_document.txt"
   
   # Via UI: Use the "Upload Documents" section
   ```

2. **Upload Reactive Cases CSV**:
   ```bash
   # Via API
   curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/assessments/{id}/reactive-analysis" \
        -F "file=@sample_data/azure_support_cases.csv"
   
   # Via UI: Use the "Reactive Case Analysis" upload area
   ```

3. **Upload Architecture Images**:
   - Place your architecture diagrams in `sample_architecture_images/`
   - Upload via the image upload interface
   - System will detect Azure services and generate documentation

### **Complete Testing Workflow**

1. **Create New Assessment**:
   - Name: "Sample E-commerce Platform Review"
   - Description: "Testing enhanced analysis with sample data"

2. **Upload All Sample Data**:
   - Architecture document (required)
   - Support cases CSV (optional but recommended)
   - Architecture images (optional)

3. **Start Enhanced Analysis**:
   - Click "Start Analysis"
   - Monitor progress through all 5 pillars
   - Enhanced agents will analyze with sophisticated algorithms

4. **Review Enhanced Results**:
   - Overall score with 20+ sub-categories
   - Enhanced recommendations with business impact
   - Reactive insights from support case patterns
   - Service detection from images

## üìä **Expected Results**

### **Analysis Quality**:
- **Overall Score**: ~65-70% (realistic scoring)
- **Sub-categories**: 20+ across 5 pillars (4-5 per pillar)
- **Recommendations**: 10+ with business impact and cost estimates
- **Detected Services**: 15-20 Azure services from combined inputs

### **Enhanced Features Demonstrated**:
- **Context-aware scoring** based on detected services
- **Cross-pillar collaboration** between agents
- **Reactive recommendations** from support case patterns
- **Professional recommendations** with implementation details

### **Sample Pillar Breakdown**:
- **Reliability**: 72.5% (High Availability, Disaster Recovery, Fault Tolerance, Backup Strategy, Reliability Monitoring)
- **Security**: 68.0% (Identity & Access, Data Protection, Network Security, Security Monitoring, Compliance)
- **Cost Optimization**: 55.5% (Resource Optimization, Cost Monitoring, Reserved Instances, Right-sizing)
- **Operational Excellence**: 78.0% (Monitoring, DevOps Practices, Automation, Documentation)
- **Performance Efficiency**: 64.5% (Scalability, Load Testing, Caching Strategy, Database Performance)

## üîß **Configuration for Testing**

Ensure your `.env` file is configured for enhanced testing:

```env
# Enhanced Emulated Mode (Current)
LLM_MODE="emulated"
ENHANCED_EMULATION="true"
RESPONSE_SOPHISTICATION="high"

# Real LLM Mode (When ready)
# LLM_MODE="real"
# OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-api-key-here"
```

## üéØ **Testing Scenarios**

### **Scenario 1: Basic Enhanced Analysis**
- Upload only `architecture_document.txt`
- Verify 20+ sub-categories and enhanced recommendations

### **Scenario 2: Reactive Case Analysis**
- Upload both document and CSV
- Verify reactive recommendations based on support patterns
- Check risk assessment and violation detection

### **Scenario 3: Multi-Modal Analysis**
- Upload document, CSV, and architecture images
- Verify comprehensive analysis with all data sources
- Check service detection and cross-referencing

### **Scenario 4: Real LLM Comparison**
- Test with enhanced emulated mode first
- Switch to real LLM mode (with API key)
- Compare analysis quality and recommendations

## üìà **Performance Expectations**

### **Enhanced Emulated Mode**:
- **Analysis Time**: ~10-15 seconds total
- **Progress Updates**: Real-time through 5 pillars
- **Consistency**: Same results for same inputs
- **Cost**: $0 (no API calls)

### **Real LLM Mode**:
- **Analysis Time**: ~30-60 seconds total
- **Progress Updates**: Real-time with actual AI processing
- **Variability**: Different insights on each run
- **Cost**: ~$0.50-2.00 per analysis (depending on content size)

## üöÄ **Next Steps**

1. **Test with Sample Data**: Use these files to verify system functionality
2. **Create Your Own**: Develop custom architecture documents and cases
3. **Real Integration**: Switch to real LLM mode when ready
4. **Production Use**: Deploy with confidence knowing the system works

## üìû **Support**

If you encounter issues with the sample data:
1. Check file formats and sizes
2. Verify API endpoints are accessible
3. Review enhanced system configuration
4. Test with smaller samples first
