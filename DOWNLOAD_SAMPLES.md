   # Upload architecture document
   curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/assessments/{id}/documents" \
        -F "file=@sample_data/architecture_document.txt"
   
   # Upload reactive cases
   curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/assessments/{id}/reactive-analysis" \
        -F "file=@sample_data/azure_support_cases.csv"
   ```
