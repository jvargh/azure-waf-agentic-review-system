# üß™ **Enhanced Azure Well-Architected Review System - Testing Guide**

This comprehensive guide will help you test all enhanced features of the Azure Well-Architected Review System.

## üéØ **Quick Start Testing**

### **Prerequisites**
- Backend running on `http://localhost:8000` (or configured port)
- Frontend running on `http://localhost:3000` (or configured port)
- Sample data files available in `/sample_data/` directory

### **1. Verify Enhanced System Status**

```bash
# Check enhanced backend status
curl http://localhost:8000/api/

# Expected response should show:
# "agent_system": "Enhanced Emulated Mode"
# "llm_mode": "emulated"
# "capabilities": { "enhanced_emulation": "Sophisticated AI response simulation" }
```

### **2. Test Enhanced Agent System**

```bash
# Check multi-agent system status
curl http://localhost:8000/api/system/agents

# Expected: 5 specialized agents with A2A collaboration protocol
```

## üìä **Complete Testing Workflow**

### **Step 1: Create Enhanced Assessment**

**Via UI:**
1. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`
2. Click "New Well-Architected Review"
3. Enter details:
   - **Name**: "Enhanced E-commerce Platform Review"
   - **Description**: "Testing enhanced multi-agent analysis with sophisticated scoring and recommendations"

**Via API:**
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/assessments" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
       "name": "Enhanced E-commerce Platform Review",
       "description": "Testing enhanced multi-agent analysis with sophisticated scoring and recommendations"
     }'

# Save the returned assessment ID for next steps
```

### **Step 2: Upload Sample Documents**

**Upload Architecture Document:**
```bash
# Replace {assessment_id} with actual ID
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/assessments/{assessment_id}/documents" \
     -F "file=@sample_data/architecture_document.txt"
```

**Upload Reactive Cases CSV:**
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/assessments/{assessment_id}/reactive-analysis" \
     -F "file=@sample_data/azure_support_cases.csv"
```

### **Step 3: Start Enhanced Analysis**

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/assessments/{assessment_id}/analyze"

# Expected response shows enhanced capabilities:
# "agents_deployed": 5
# "capabilities": {
#   "image_analysis": "Architecture diagram analysis enabled",
#   "reactive_case_analysis": "Support case pattern analysis enabled",
#   "a2a_collaboration": "Agent-to-Agent protocol active"
# }
```

### **Step 4: Monitor Enhanced Progress**

Watch real-time progress through all 5 pillars:

```bash
# Check progress (repeat every few seconds)
curl http://localhost:8000/api/assessments/{assessment_id}

# Progress will show:
# 0% ‚Üí 20% ‚Üí 40% ‚Üí 60% ‚Üí 80% ‚Üí 100%
# Status: pending ‚Üí analyzing ‚Üí completed
```

### **Step 5: Verify Enhanced Results**

```bash
# Get comprehensive enhanced scorecard
curl http://localhost:8000/api/assessments/{assessment_id}/scorecard

# Verify enhanced features:
# - overall_score: ~65-70%
# - pillar_scores: 5 pillars with 4-5 sub-categories each (20+ total)
# - recommendations: 10+ with business impact and cost estimates
# - agent_metrics: Performance data for all 5 agents

    "Disaster Recovery": {"score": 65, "percentage": 65},
    "Fault Tolerance": {"score": 85, "percentage": 85},
    "Backup Strategy": {"score": 70, "percentage": 70},
    "Reliability Monitoring": {"score": 62, "percentage": 62}
  }
}
```

### **2. Enhanced Recommendations**

**What to Verify:**
- **Business Impact**: Recommendations include business impact analysis
- **Cost Estimates**: Where applicable, cost estimates provided
- **Implementation Effort**: Effort levels (High/Medium/Low) specified
- **Azure Services**: Specific Azure services recommended

**Example Enhanced Recommendation:**
```json
{
  "priority": "High",
  "title": "Implement Multi-Region Deployment Strategy",
  "description": "Deploy applications across multiple Azure regions with automated failover to achieve 99.99% availability SLA",
  "business_impact": "Reduces downtime by 90% and protects against regional outages",
  "estimated_cost": "$500-2000/month depending on scale",
  "azure_service": "Azure Traffic Manager + Azure Site Recovery",
  "implementation_effort": "High"
}
```

### **3. Reactive Case Analysis**

**What to Verify:**
- **Pattern Detection**: System identifies support case patterns
- **Well-Architected Violations**: Maps cases to WA framework violations
- **Risk Assessment**: Overall risk score and level
- **Reactive Recommendations**: Specific recommendations based on case patterns

**Check Reactive Analysis Results:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/api/assessments/{assessment_id}/reactive-analysis

# Expected results:
# - total_cases: 21
# - patterns_identified: 8+
# - wa_violations: Multiple violations across pillars
# - risk_level: "Medium" or "High"
```

### **4. Agent Collaboration Metrics**

**What to Verify:**

## üîß **Configuration Testing**

### **Test LLM Mode Switching**

**Enhanced Emulated Mode (Current):**
```bash
# In backend/.env
LLM_MODE="emulated"
ENHANCED_EMULATION="true"

# Restart backend and verify:
curl http://localhost:8000/api/ | grep "Enhanced Emulated Mode"
```

**Real LLM Mode (With API Key):**
```bash
# In backend/.env
LLM_MODE="real"
OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-api-key-here"

# Restart backend and verify:
curl http://localhost:8000/api/ | grep "Real LLM Mode"
```

## üìà **Performance Testing**

### **Expected Performance Metrics**

**Enhanced Emulated Mode:**
- **Total Analysis Time**: 10-15 seconds
- **Progress Updates**: Every 2-3 seconds
- **Memory Usage**: <500MB
- **CPU Usage**: <20% during analysis

**Real LLM Mode:**
- **Total Analysis Time**: 30-60 seconds
- **API Calls**: 15-25 calls per analysis
- **Cost**: $0.50-2.00 per analysis
- **Variability**: Different results each run

## üêõ **Troubleshooting**

### **Common Issues**

**1. "Enhanced Emulated Mode" not showing:**
- Check `LLM_MODE="emulated"` in `.env`
- Verify `ENHANCED_EMULATION="true"`
- Restart backend service

**2. Sub-categories showing as basic (8-10 instead of 20+):**
- Ensure enhanced agent code is deployed
- Check agent initialization logs
- Verify no code rollback occurred

**3. Recommendations missing business impact:**
- Confirm enhanced recommendation generation is active
- Check agent collaboration is working
- Verify scorecard API returns enhanced data

**4. Analysis taking too long:**
- Normal in enhanced mode: 10-15 seconds
- If >30 seconds in emulated mode, check logs
- Verify agent system is initialized properly

### **Debug Commands**

```bash
# Check backend logs
tail -f /var/log/supervisor/backend.*.log

# Verify agent system status
curl http://localhost:8000/api/system/agents

# Test individual assessment
curl http://localhost:8000/api/assessments/{id}

# Check enhanced configuration
curl http://localhost:8000/api/ | jq '.capabilities'
